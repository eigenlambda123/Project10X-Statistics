    "> With more days of weather data (say, over a year instead of just 60 days), you'd get a **more stable and reliable estimate** of the rain probability. Small datasets can be misleading due to short-term fluctuations, but larger datasets reduce variability and give stronger evidence — this is another example of the **Law of Large Numbers** in action."
