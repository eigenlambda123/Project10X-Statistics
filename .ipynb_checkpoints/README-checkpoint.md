# Stats10X Builder Series

> Learn **Statistics** by building 10 hands-on, visual, and interactive projects inspired by key topics in foundational probability and statistics.

---

## About

This repository is designed to help you **master Statistics by building real, practical projects** that align with core statistical ideasâ€”probability, distributions, sampling, hypothesis testing, and more. Instead of rote learning, you'll simulate, visualize, and apply statistical reasoning to concrete examples.

This is the **Statistics counterpart** to my [Project10X â€“ The Backend Builder Series](https://github.com/eigenlambda123/Project10X-The-Backend-Builder-Series.git), and follows the same project-driven learning philosophy I used for my [Linear Algebra 10X Builder Series](https://github.com/eigenlambda123/Linear-Algebra-10X-Builder-Series).

## Goals

* Build strong statistical intuition through simulation and visualization
* Learn practical statistics concepts by implementing them from scratch
* Make abstract concepts tangible: sampling distributions, p-values, CLT, and more
* Lay a solid foundation for data science, machine learning, and scientific computing
* Practice clean, reproducible code with a math-first mindset
