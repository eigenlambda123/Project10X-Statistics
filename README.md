# Stats10X Builder Series

> Learn **Statistics** by building 10 hands-on, visual, and interactive projects inspired by key topics in foundational probability and statistics.

## About This Repo

This repository is my personal project to **master Statistics by building real, practical projects** aligned with core statistical ideas like probability, distributions, sampling, hypothesis testing, and more.


---

## My Goals

* Build strong statistical intuition through simulation and visualization
* Learn practical statistics concepts by implementing them from scratch
* Make abstract concepts tangible: sampling distributions, p-values, the Central Limit Theorem, and more
* Lay a solid foundation for data science and machine learning
